Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

### Colour Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the website with a mix of light colors for the background and darker colors to highlight the writing and the text headings. 
I choose the main background color for the website first and I picked 
the rest of the colors to go with it. I tried to ensure the headings were visible through the images used 
in this project. i was influenced by the love Running project.


The following colors were used a mix of hex colors and rgba to make the color and contrast
lighter and darker as needed 
#323232 a dark grey
#DDDOC8 a light shade of orange
#252525 dark dark shade of grey
#f5f5dc a shade of yellow
#2b2d2f dark shade of green
#fff a light shade of blue
rgb 245.245,20 Beige
rgba (221, 208, 200, .6)  lighter contrast

### Typography
I choose fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which is a very   
popular website for importing fonts. I chose it for accessibility and it had the  
font weights very easily displayed. It was very easy to import and copy the font and it did
not require for the font to be downloaded.  
I picked the weight 300 for each font. Oswald and Roboto.  
I used the fonts Oswald and Roboto in this project. I used the font as it was
 clear  and simple. I used the weight 300 as it has a nice finish and I was influenced
 from the Love Running project. I wanted to create a clean simple font-style.
 The two I used are very clear and neat.

For the icons in this project. I obtained them from Fontawesome V5. 
I was influenced by the Love Running Project. 


https://fontawesome.com/ was where the icons were taken from for the footer.


### Imagery

The images used in this project are taken from Unsplash and Pexel. I
was searching for clear and clean images with a high resolution. 
https://nicolaslule.com/responsive-full-width-hero-image-using-flex/ is a website sour
ce which I used to assist me code the hero-image in this project.
The hero image is from 
<https://www.istockphoto.com/search/search-by-asset?searchbyasset=true&assettype=image&alloweduse=availableforalluses&assetid=1322925863&page=2>

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
