Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.





Design 
The color scheme was used was W3C ValidatorThe W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.
It was sued to validate the code on Ind# PROJECT NAME TO GO HERE

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

### Colour Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the website with a mix of light colors for the background and darker colors to highlight the writing and the text headings. 
I choose the main background color for the website first and I picked 
the rest of the colors to go with it. I tried to ensure the headings were visible through the images used 
in this project. i was influenced by the love Running project.


The following colors were used a mix of hex colors and rgba to make the color and contrast
lighter and darker as needed 
#323232 a dark grey
#DDDOC8 a light shade of orange
#252525 dark dark shade of grey
#f5f5dc a shade of yellow
#2b2d2f dark shade of green
#fff a light shade of blue
rgb 245.245,20 Beige
rgba (221, 208, 200, .6)  lighter contrast

https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/website-color-schemes#Top_30_Website_Color_Schemes was also 
accessed when researching colors. 

### Typography
I choose fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which is a very   
popular website for importing fonts. I chose it for accessibility and it had the  
font weights very easily displayed. It was very easy to import and copy the font and it did
not require for the font to be downloaded.  
I picked the weight 300 for each font. Oswald and Roboto.  
I used the fonts Oswald and Roboto in this project. I used the font as it was
 clear  and simple. I used the weight 300 as it has a nice finish and I was influenced
 from the Love Running project. I wanted to create a clean simple font-style.
 The two I used are very clear and neat.

For the icons in this project. I obtained them from Fontawesome V5. 
I was influenced by the Love Running Project. 


https://fontawesome.com/ was where the icons were taken from for the footer.


### Imagery

The images used in this project are taken from Unsplash and Pexel. I
was searching for clear and clean images with a high resolution. 
https://nicolaslule.com/responsive-full-width-hero-image-using-flex/ is a website sour
ce which I used to assist me code the hero-image in this project.
The hero image is from

booking form.



### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.
for this project I used baslsaiq.

## Features



This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

put th nav bar and footer in here 



### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility



## Technologies Used


### Languages Used

As this is my first HTML & CSS are the only languages used throughout this project.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used



## Deployment & Local Development


### Deployment

 I saved the code after it was added to Codeanywhere . I committed the changes and then pushed the final code to Github. I
I saved the settings on my github page as a main root source and then I deployed the pages to github.
### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork


#### How to Clone
