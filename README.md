### Colour Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the website with a 
mix of light colors for the background and darker colors to highlight 
the writing and the text headings. 
I choose the main background color for the website first and I picked 
the rest of the colors to go with it. 
I tried to ensure the headings were visible through the images used 
in this project. I was influenced by the love Running project.


The following colors were used a mix of hex colors and rgba to 
make the color and contrast
lighter and darker as needed 
#323232 a dark grey
#DDDOC8 a light shade of orange
#252525 dark dark shade of grey
#f5f5dc a shade of yellow
#2b2d2f dark shade of green
#fff a light shade of blue
rgb 245.245,20 Beige
rgba (221, 208, 200, .6)  lighter contrast

### Typography
I choose fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) which is a very   
popular website for importing fonts.
I chose it for accessibility and it had the  font weights very easily displayed. 
It was very easy to import and copy the font and it did
not require for the font to be downloaded.  
I picked the weight 300 for each font. Oswald and Roboto.  
I used the fonts Oswald and Roboto in this project. I used the font as it was
 clear  and simple. I used the weight 300 as it has a nice finish and I was influenced
 from the Love Running project. I wanted to create a clean simple font-style.
 The two I used are very clear and neat.

For the icons in this project. I obtained them from Fontawesome V5. 
I was influenced by the Love Running Project

[here is a link to the webpage] (https://fontawesome.com/) 
was where the icons were taken from for the footer.


### Imagery

I was searching for clear and clean images with a high resolution. 


this a website source which I used to assist me code the hero-image in this project.
